# Blade language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Blade files in Atom.

Adapted from Atom's language-php package, originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [PHP TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/php.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
