# Blade language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Blade files in Atom.

Adapted from Atom's language-php package, originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [PHP TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/php.tmbundle).

No longer updated. See [jawee/language-blade](https://github.com/jawee/language-blade) for an alternative.
